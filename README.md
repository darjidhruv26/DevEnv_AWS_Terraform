- HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

# Stape: 1

- Create a file 
```providers.tf```
```bash
  terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region                  = "ap-south-1"
  shared_credentials_file = "~/.aws/credentials"
  profile                 = "[replace you aws user]"
}
```
And run this command `terraform init`

# Stape: 2 

## Stape: 2.1 Deploy the VPC

- Create a file `main.tf `
```bash
  resource "aws_vpc" "dhruv_vpc" {
  cidr_block           = "10.123.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  enable_dns_support   = true

  tags = {
    name = "dev"
  }
}
```

```terraform plan```
- The terraform plan command creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure. By default, when Terraform creates a plan it:
-- Reads the current state of any already-existing remote objects to make sure that the Terraform state is up-to-date.
-- Compares the current configuration to the prior state and noting any differences.
-- Proposes a set of change actions that should, if applied, make the remote objects match the configuration.

```terraform state```
- The command will list all resources in the state file matching the given addresses (if any). If no addresses are given, all resources are listed.

```terraform show```
- The terraform show command is used to provide human-readable output from a state or plan file. This can be used to inspect a plan to ensure that the planned operations are expected, or to inspect the current state as Terraform sees it.Machine-readable output is generated by adding the -json command-line flag.

```terraform apply```
- When you run terraform apply without passing a saved plan file, Terraform automatically creates a new execution plan as if you had run terraform plan, prompts you to approve that plan, and takes the indicated actions. You can use all of the planning modes and planning options to customize how Terraform will create the plan.You can pass the -auto-approve option to instruct Terraform to apply the plan without asking for confirmation.

```terraform destroy``
- The terraform destroy command is a convenient way to destroy all remote objects managed by a particular Terraform configuration.
